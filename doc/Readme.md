# Exploring the Effect of Sparse Storage Formats

---
Sparse matrix codes show different performance when a different
storage format is selected. In this report, we explore this using
four different storage format and for two different sparse
kernels. This report is based on [Axb]() published in 2018.


### 1- Sparse Storage Formats

There are several compressed formats for storing sparse matrices.
In all sparse storage formats, the nonzero elements are compressed
and stored in different arrays. Four different formats are explained in this section.
compressed sparse row (CSR), compressed sparse column(CSC), and two different diagonal formats. To illustrate different
formats, an example sparse matrix shown in Figure1 is used.

Figure 1: a sparse matrix with 4 rows, 4 columns, and 7 non-zero elements

**1-1- CSR:** Storing non-zero elements of a sparse matrix into a linear array *val* is done by going over each row in
order,and storing the non-zero elements to a linear array in the order they appear in the walk. Location and column
indices of non-zero elements of the *val* array in order stored in *row_ptr* and *col_idx*. The first element of row *i*
is stored *val[row_ptr[i]]* and the column index of the non-zero
element in *val[i]* is stored in *col_idx[i]*.<br>
val:[1,3,5,4,6,2,7]<br>
row_ptr:[0,1,3,5,7]<br>
col_idx:[0,0,1,1,2,2,3]<br>

The CSR storage of the sparse matrix in Figure 1 is shown above.
As shown, the non-zero element 5 in row 1 and column 1 is stored
in *val[row_ptr[1]+1]* and its
column index is stored in *col_idx[row_ptr[1]+1]* where one is
the offset of the element from the first element in row one.

**1-2- CSC:** Storing the non-zero elements of a sparse matrix into a linear array is done by going over each column in order,
and writing the non-zero elements to a linear array in the order they appear in the walk. Location and row indices of
non-zero elements of the *val* array are in order stored in *col_ptr* and *row_idx*. The first element of column *i* is stored
in val[col_ptr[i]] and the row index of the non-zero elements in *val[j]* is stored in *row_idx[j]*.

val:[1,3,5,4,6,2,7]<br>
col_ptr:[0,2,4,6,7]<br>
row_idx:[0,1,1,2,2,3,3]<br>

The CSC storage of the sparse matrix in Figure 1 is shown above.
As shown, the non-zero element 5 in column 1 and row 1 is stored in *val[col_ptr[1]+0]* and its row
index is stored in *row_idx[col_ptr[1]]+0]* where zero is the offset of the element from the first column.<br>

**1-3- Diagonal Formats:** Since in a banded matrix, non-zero elements are
limited to diagonal bands, we only need to store
elements based on their diagonals. For this storage format, two
implementations are presented. The first one stores non-zero
elements diagonal by diagonal, and the second one stores them row by row.<br>

**Diagonal 1:** The first diagonal format stores diagonals in
a two dimensional
array that each row contains one diagonal. So, the row
numbers of this matrix is equal to number of non-zero diagonals of
the banded matrix. Figure 1 can be considered as a banded matrix and
its corresponding diagonal format is shown below. *dd* is
the array that stores diagonals. we store non-zero elements (diagonals)
in *dd*. Size of *Offset* shows the number of
diagonals. *offset[i]=0* is the main diagonal.
*offsset[i]<0* is up-diagonal, and *offset[i]>0* is sub-diagonal.<br>

<br>

<br>

*Note:* to solve a linear system of the form *Ly = d*, *L* should be a
lower triangular matrix. So we only store main
diagonal and sub-diagonals for a lower triangular banded matrix.
*i=0* means main diagonal and for main diagonal we know row and column
is the same.
For sub-diagonals *row>column*.<br>

**Diagonal 2:** Second format that is suggested for storing a banded matrix,
processes matrix row by row and stored every
non-zero elements of banded matrix in *dm*. So, in *dm[0,*]* is
stored non-zero element of first row of banded matrix.
*dm[1,*]* contains non-zero elements of second row of banded matrix.

### 2- Kernel Variants
Sparse kernels provide a different performance depending on
the sparse storage format they use. In this section, we use
two sparse kernels, sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV)
and sparse lower triangular solver (SpTRSV) and show how
they should be redesigned for the four different storage formats
shown in Section 1.

#### 2-1- Sparse Matrix â€“ Vector Multiplication (SpMV)
SpMV kernel computes *y = A\* x* where *A* is a sparse kernel and *x* and *y*
are dense vectors. *A* can be stored in any of the four formats are introduced here.
We will explain how SpMV code differ using different formats.

**CSR:** the code shown down in *Listing 1*, is the CSR variant of SpMV.
The Sp-CSR code iterates over rows and computes each row of *result* one by one by order. We have access to all elements of
each row by order. So, For each iteration *i* we can compute *result[i,0]*.
```
  for (int i=0; i<row; i++)
    {
        for (int j=ptr[i]; j<ptr[i+1]; j++ )
        {
            s = val[j] * v->array[idx[j]][0] + s;
        }

       result->array[i][0] = s;
        s = 0;
    }
 ``` 
<div align="center"> Listing 1: CSR variant of SpMV </div>

**CSC:** The code shown in *Listing 2* is the CSC variant of SpMV.
The SpMV-CSC code iterates over columns and computes the partial multiplication
of each element in *result*.
The computed solution in *result* is final when all iterations are finished.
This is the opposite of the SpMV CSR code where each iteration *i* computes
the final element *result[i,0]*.

```
 for (int i=0; i<col; i++ ) 
 {
  for (int j=ptr[i]; j<ptr[i+1]; j++)
    {
     result->array[idx[j]][0] += val[j]*v->array[i][0] ;

    }
  } 
 ```        
<div align="center"> Listing 2: the CSC variant of SpMV </div>

**Diagonal:** for diagonal storage format two implementations are introduced.
The code in *Listing 3* shows the implementation of SpMV for the first diagonal
format. As shown, the code iterates over each diagonal that is stored in *d* and computes the
partial result of each element in *result*. To compute what element in *result* should be
update, the diagonal information *offset* is used.

```
   for (int l = 0; l < d->rowNo; l++) {
         for (int k = 0; k < d->colNo - abs(offset[l]); k++) {
             if (offset[l] > 0) {
                 i = k + offset[l];
                 j = k;

                 result->array[i][0] += d->array[l][k] * v->array[j][0];
             }
             if (offset[l] == 0) {
                 i = k;
                 j = k;
                 result->array[i][0] += d->array[l][k] * v->array[j][0];
             }
             if (offset[l] < 0) {
                 i = k;
                 j = k - offset[l];

                 result->array[i][0] += d->array[l][k] * v->array[j][0];
             }
         }
     }
 ``` 
<div align="center"> Listing 3: the diagonal1 variant of SpMV </div>

For the second diagonal format, the code for SpMV is shown in *Listing 4*.
As shown the code computes one element of *result* in each iteration. Since we stored non-zero elements row by row in *d*, *d[i,*]*
contains the elements of row *i* . But to find column number we need to check whether *i* is bigger or smaller than 
number of diagonals (d1) . We have different approach to find number column and compute *result[i,0]* for each condition.

*Note:* d1 = dNum/2 because in this case, we just considered main and sub-diagonals.

```
  int d1 = dNum/2; // dNum stores the number of diagonals

     for(int i=0; i<row; i++)
     {
         if(i<=d1)
         {
             for(int j=0; j<=i ; j++)
             {
                 result->array[i][0] += (d->array[i][j]*v->array[j][0]);
             }
         }
         if(i>d1)
         {
             for (int j = i; j >= j-d1; j--)
             {
                 result->array[i][0] += (d->array[i][d1]*v->array[j][0]);
                 d1--;
             }
             d1=dNum/2;
         }
     }
 ```

#### 2-2- Sparse Triangular Solve:For Different Formats
We have the equation *Ly = d* in which *L* is lower triangular matrix that is
stored in CSC, CSC or Diagonal format, *y* is the unknown
vector and *d* is the known right hand side.
In the following we explain how we solve this equation
in different format of *L*.

**CSR:** *L* is a sparse matrix in CSR storage format. In this format, shown in *Listing 5*,
we compute all unknowns by order.
It means we first compute *y[0,0]* then we use that to compute *y[1,0]* and so on
and we continue until we find the last unknown. each iteration of *i* computes *y[i,0]*.

```
   y->array[0][0] = d->array[0][0] / L->val[0];
    for (int i=1; i<rowNo; i++)
    {
        for (int j=L->ptr[i]; j<L->ptr[i+1]-1; j++ )
        {
            s = (L->val[j] * y->array[L->idx[j]][0]) + s;

        }
        y->array[i][0] = (d->array[i][0] - s) / L->val[L->ptr[i+1]-1];
        s = 0;
    }
 ```
<div align="center"> Listing 5: solving equation in CSR format </div>

**CSC:** In CSC format, shown in *Listing 6*, we access elements of *L* column by column. First we copy *d* into *y*.
In order to find *y[i,0]* we should have access to all elements of row *i*, so we should process all columns to find that.
Therefore, we can not compute each *y[i,0]* until we finish all iteration entirely. It means we can compute
none of elements of *y*, until we iterate for loop for all *i*s.

```

    for (int i=0; i<rowNo; i++)
      {
            y->array[i][0] /=  L->val[L->ptr[i]];
            for (int j=L->ptr[i]+1; j<L->ptr[i+1]; j++ )
            {
                y->array[L->idx[j]][0] -=  L->val[j]*y->array[i][0];
            }
      }
 ```
<div align="center"> Listing 6: solving equation in CSC format </div>

**diagonal1:** To solve a system of linear equation when the sparse matrix is stored in diagonal format, we have following
code shown in *Listing 8*. In this format first we copy *d* into *y* vector. Then we need to find row index.
the following code shows how we find and stores row indexes.

```
for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        k=i;
        for(int j=0; j< rowNo-l; j++)
        {
                r->array[i][j] = k;
                k++;
        }
        l++;
    }
```
<div align="center"> Listing 7: computing row index </div>

By having row index we can multiply each element of *L* with corresponding *y* for each row to compute the result(unknowns).


```   
    y->array[0][0] = d->array[0][0] / L->array[0][0];
    for(int i=1; i<rowNo; i++)
    {
        l=1;
        for(int j=1; j< n; j++)
        {
            for(int k=0; k<rowNo-l; k++)
            {
                if (r->array[j][k] == i)
                {
                    s += L->array[j][k] * y->array[k][0];

                }
            }
        l++;
        }
        y->array[i][0] = (d->array[i][0] - s) / L->array[0][i];
        s = 0;
    }
 ```
<div align="center"> Listing 8: solving equation in diagonal1 format </div>

**Diagonal2:** second format that is suggested for storing the matrix in diagonal format, shown in *Listing 9*, is different.
In this format, because we stored non-zero elements of banded matrix row by row, we use an implementation like CSR format.
this implementation is more efficient than diagonal1. Because special locality for finding unknowns is better than diagonal1.
This is because for each iteration *row i* we can compute *y[i,0]*. Of course, Before the execution of inner for, we check whether
*d1* is bigger or smaller than *i*, because we have two different implementations to compute column number and  *y[i,0]* 
in each condition.

```
    int d1 = dia/2; // dia is the number of diagonals

    for(int i=0; i<rowNo; i++)
    {
        if(i<=d1)
        {
            for(int j=0; j<i ; j++)
            {
               s += L->array[i][j]*y->array[j][0];
            }
          y->array[i][0] = (d->array[i][0] - s) / L->array[i][i];

        }

         if(i>d1)
        {
            for (int j = i-1; j > j-d1; j--)
            {
                d1--;
                s += L->array[i][d1]*y->array[j][0];
                //d1--;
            }
          d1=dia/2;
          y->array[i][0] = (d->array[i][0] - s) / L->array[i][d1];
        }
        s = 0;
    }
 ```
